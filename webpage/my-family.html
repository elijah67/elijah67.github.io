<p>The family members outside of my house are my aunt's, my uncle's, my grandma, and my grandpa.</p>
<p>For fun, we like to play board games,swim,and go places.</p>
<p>Our family is unique, because we are a large family</p>
<p>I love that my family likes being together, is loving, and that my family is caring.</p>
<p>My favorite memory is when we went on our cruise. I like this memory, because it was fun.</p>
